# TSAPI-py

The TSAPI-py aims to make the TSAPI easy to access via Python. 

Currently the project provides a python representation of the TSAPI so that the data can be manipulated accordingly. 

These are early days for the project but the aim is to create a PYPI package that other applications can rely on.
